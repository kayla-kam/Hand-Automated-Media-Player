# Hand-Automated-Media-Player
A hand automation media player that pauses, skips/rewinds the video, or increases/decreases the video volume based on different hand signals. 

The tools used are Mediapipe, cv2, and python. 

Throughout the simple project I have assigned different hand poses to different types of media automations such as pausing and skipping into youtube videos. The hand poses are recognized through Mediapipe's landmarks and the usage of my camera through the cv2 library.
